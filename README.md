# PyTorch Training Utilities

This repository contains utilities and scripts for training object detection models using PyTorch.

## About

Major parts of this code were generated or co-written with the help of ChatGPT and adapted for my own projects.  
It works for me â€“ if it works for you too, great! If not, you're on your own. ðŸ˜‰ 
I simply wanted to share this setup as it was tough for me to find something similar when first starting with Pytorch.

## How to train a modell

To start a training session on any of the supported models for object detection:

from scripts.train import train
  
train(DATA_DIR="", MODEL_NAME='ssd_mobilenetv3', BATCH_SIZE=4, EPOCHS=50, NUM_CLASSES=2, IMGSZ=640)

To start a training session on masked_rcnn modell use this instead:

from scripts.train_mask import train as train_masked
  
train_masked(DATA_DIR="", BATCH_SIZE=4, EPOCHS=50, NUM_CLASSES=2, IMGSZ=640)

WARNING: 
NUM_CLASSES is always 1 more than your number of classes. The models counts bakground as a class. In the json file you always have to have a supercategory:

categories":[{"id":0,"name":"bkgd","supercategory":"none"}, {"id":0,"name":"YOUR_FIRST_CLASS","supercategory":"bkgd".....}]


### Dataset structure
This training example uses coco.json annotation files to train the models. 
The training script expects the dataset to be structured as shown below. 
DATA_DIR="" in this example should be set to DATA_DIR="path-to/dataset"
